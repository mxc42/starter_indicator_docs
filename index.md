These pages document the use of the Starter's Indicator by Morgan Hunter.

The Starter's Indicator is used by timers who use FinishLynx to communicate with starters that they are ready to capture a race start. This is an automated, wireless alternative to using flags or a hardwired light indicator. It consists of a [base station](/starter_indicator_docs/base) that plugs into the timing computer via USB, and a [remote](/starter_indicator_docs/remote) held by the starter that displays the current FinishLynx status.

# Getting Started

1. [Purchase a system](/starter_indicator_docs/purchase).
2. [Setup a system](/starter_indicator_docs/setup).
3. Power on the remote, plug the transmitter in, and start timing.

# Motivation

Morgan has been timing track meets since he was 9 years old, and has never been satisfied with existing options for armed indication, especially when timing at tracks without permanent solutions already in place. After completing a Computer Engineering degree decided an easily transportable, wireless, low setup indicator would be worth building.
