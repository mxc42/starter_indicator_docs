## Power

The remote is equipped with a battery that gives around 90 hours of runtime. A power switch and micro USB port can be found on the bottom of the device, 

## Indicator

The remote has two indicators, and LED and a flip disk. When a race is armed, these are both turned red. The redunancy is for greater visibility - the LED is hard to see in daylight, but easy to see in lower light. The reverse is true for the flip disk.
