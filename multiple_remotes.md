You may use multiple remotes with one base station. This can be useful if you have multiple starters. In this configuration, you should have exactly one remote configured as a primary remote, followed by any number of secondary remotes.

# Primary Remote

One primary remote is needed for each setup. It is the only configuration that sends acknowledgments to the base. Without a primary remote, the base will think no remotes are receiving its broadcasts. The primary remote is also the only configuration that will send battery low status to the base station.

Primary remotes can be identified by a red flash on start up.

# Secondary Remote(s)

Unlike a primary remote, a secondary remote is not required for a complete system. You can also have as many as you wish on one system -- adding more does not in anyway change the effectiveness of other remotes, as secondary remotes only listen to the base without talking back. For this reason, if you try to use a base with only a secondary remote, the base will assume no connection and display a purple LED.

Secondary remotes can be identified by a blue flash on the indicator LED on start up.

# Changing Remote Configuration

Primary and secondary remotes have identical hardware, and can be flashed to either configuration. [Contact Morgan](mailto:morgandavidhunter@gmail.com) for more information.
